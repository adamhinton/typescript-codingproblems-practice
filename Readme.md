# Logging TypeScript coding problems

I have been learning TypeScript and this is one fun way to track my progress.

Here I am logging TS problems that I have solved, I started with Codewars but may branch out to Leetcode or something.

I recently started learning TS, it will be fun to look back and see how far I come.

I will also be making React projects in TS.
